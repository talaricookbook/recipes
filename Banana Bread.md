# 🍌 Banana Bread

## 🛒 Ingredients
- [ ] 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- [ ] 1/2 cup (1 stick or 115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- [ ] 3/4 cup (150g) brown sugar
- [ ] 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- [ ] 1/3 cup (80g) sour cream
- [ ] 2 cups mashed bananas (about 4 large ripe bananas)
- [ ] 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- [ ] 3/4 cup (100g) chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)

## 🥘 Instructions
### 1. Prep
- Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C)
- Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan or coat with nonstick spray. Set aside

### 2. Mix Dry Ingredients
- Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl

### 3. Mix Wet Ingredients
- Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes
- On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition
- Beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract on medium speed until combined

### 4. Combine
- With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain
- Do not overmix
- Fold in the nuts, if using

### 5. Bake
- Spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 60-65 minutes
- Loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil after 30 minutes to help prevent the top and sides from getting too brown
- A toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean when the bread is done
- Remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack

## 💡 Notes / Tips
- Candied pecans are great
