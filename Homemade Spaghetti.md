# 🍝 Homemade Spaghetti

## 🛒 Ingredients
- [ ] 2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for dusting) (300g)
- [ ] 3 large eggs
- [ ] 1/2 tsp sea salt
- [ ] 1/2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

## 🥘 Instructions

### 1. Create a Well
- Mound the flour on a clean work surface or in a large bowl
- Create a deep well in the center of the flour

### 2. Mix
- Crack the eggs into the well
- Add the salt and olive oil
- Using a fork, gently whisk the eggs, slowly incorporating the flour from the sides until a shaggy dough forms

### 3. Knead
- Bring the dough together with your hands
- Knead on a lightly floured surface for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic
- If the dough is too dry, add a teaspoon of water; if too sticky, add a little more flour

### 4. Rest
- Form the dough into a ball
- Wrap tightly in plastic wrap
- Let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax

### 5. Roll & Cut
- Divide the dough into smaller portions
- Roll out each portion until very thin (using a rolling pin or pasta machine)
- Cut into thin spaghetti strips using a sharp knife or pasta cutter
- Dust the cut noodles with flour to prevent sticking and form into loose nests

### 6. Cook
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil
- Add the fresh pasta and cook for 2-3 minutes until al dente (fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried)
- Drain and toss with your favorite sauce

## 💡 Notes / Tips
- For a richer pasta, you can use more egg yolks.
- 00 flour works best for a silky texture, but all-purpose works well too.
- The resting time is crucial; don't skip it or the dough will be rubbery and hard to roll.
