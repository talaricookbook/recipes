## 🥘 Instructions

### 1. Brown the Butter
- Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C)
- Place butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet
- Transfer skillet to oven and heat until butter is melted and well browned, 10 to 20 minutes

### 2. Mix Dry Ingredients

    - Cornmeal
    - Flour
    - Sugar
    - Salt
    - Baking powder
    - Baking soda

### 3. Mix Wet Ingredients

    - Eggs
    - Sour cream
    - Buttermilk
- Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the reserved browned butter

### 4. Combine
- Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined (do not overmix)

### 5. Bake
- Swirl the hot skillet (with the remaining 1 tbsp butter) to coat all surfaces
- Spoon batter into the skillet and smooth the top lightly
- Return to oven and bake until light golden brown on top and a wooden skewer inserted comes out clean (20 to 25 minutes)

### 6. Cool & Serve
- Let cool for 10 minutes
- Serve warm with extra butter and honey

## 💡 Notes / Tips
- **Storage**: Leftover cornbread can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
- **Why Brown Butter?**: It gives the cornbread a sweet, nutty flavor that pairs perfectly with the corn.
- **Skillet**: Using the preheated cast iron skillet creates a supremely crisp crust.
